# Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Measurement with Arduino

This project uses an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to measure distance by sending and receiving sound pulses. 
The distance in centimeters is calculated and displayed via the serial monitor.

## Components
- 1x Arduino UNO
- 1x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
