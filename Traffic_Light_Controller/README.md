# Traffic Light Controller
This Arduino code simulates a traffic light sequence using LEDs (green, yellow, red) connected to pins 13, 12, and 11. It cycles through each light with different delays: green (3s), yellow (1s), and red (4s).

## Components
- 1x Arduino UNO  
- 3x LEDs (green, yellow, red)  
- 3x 220Î© Resistors  
- Jumper Wires  
- Breadboard
