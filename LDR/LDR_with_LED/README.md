# Photoresistor (LDR) Sensor with LED Indicator
This project reads light intensity from a photoresistor (LDR) and displays the value in the Serial Monitor.
If the light level is below a threshold, the LED turns off; otherwise, it turns on.


## Components
- 1x Arduino UNO
- 1x Photoresistor (LDR)
- 1x LED
- 1x 220Ω Resistor (for LED)
- 1x 10kΩ Resistor (for LDR voltage devider)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
