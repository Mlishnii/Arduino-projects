# Interactive Traffic Light with Button
This Arduino code controls a traffic light system (green, yellow, red LEDs) with an added button. Normally, the light cycles green (3s) → yellow (1s) → red (4s).
When the button is pressed, the system pauses and holds the red light until released.

## Components
- 1x Arduino UNO  
- 3x LEDs (green, yellow, red)
- 1x Push button
- 3x 220Ω Resistors
- 1x 10kΩ Resistor
- Jumper Wires  
- Breadboard
